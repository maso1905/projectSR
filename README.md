# Svergies Radio Tablå

### This is my final project in the course DT084G Introduction to programming with JavaScript.

> A tableu web application made with the open API of the Swedish Radio. The purpose of the project was to only use JavaScript. I used AJAX in order to format the desired API’s URL to JSON.
